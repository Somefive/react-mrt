We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pretrained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.","citations":["1e077413b25c4d34945cc2707e17e46ed4fe784a","27e98e09cf09bc13c913d01676e5f32624011050","26b47e35fe6e4260fdf7b7cc98f279a73c277494","e0222a1ae6874f7fff128c3da8769ab95963da04","af5c4b80fbf847f69a202ba5a780a3dd18c1a027","93b8da28d006415866bf48f9a6e06b5242129195","0c47cad9729c38d9db1f75491b1ee4bd883a5d4e","421fc2556836a6b441de806d7b393a35b6eaea58"],"references":["687bac2d3320083eb4530bf18bb8f8f721477600","0bb4cadc80c0afaf29c57518dc9c06f8fcfa5f38","3c78c6df5eb1695b6a399e346dde880af27d1016","f37e1b62a767a307c046404ca96bc140b3e68cb5","dac72f2c509aee67524d3321f77e97e8eff51de6","1eb09fecd75eb27825dce4f964b97f4f5cc399d7","f04df4e20a18358ea2f689b4c129781628ef7fc1","87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f","59761abc736397539bdd01ad7f9d91c8607c0457","4aa9f5150b46320f534de4747a2dd0cd7f3fe292","05dd7254b632376973f3a1b4d39485da17814df5","bc8fa64625d9189f5801837e7b133e7fe3c581f7","10f97f1fb4f5c2c8e6c44d4a33da46d331dd4aeb","007ab5528b3bd310a80d553cccad4b78dc496b02","0a6383b13794452fb7339a7f8a5384885186ccf6","5d833331b0e22ff359db05c62a8bca18c4f04b68"]},{"paper_id":"204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776","paper_title":"Attention Is All You Need","paper_year":2017,"paper_venue":"NIPS","paper_citations":997,"paper_abstract":"The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent orconvolutional neural networks in an encoder and decoder configuration.

Neural autoregressive and seq2seq models that generate text by sampling words sequentially, with each word conditioned on the previous model, are state-of-the-art for several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure of sample quality. Language models are typically trained via maximum likelihood and most often with teacher forcing. Teacher forcing is well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality because generating text requires conditioning on sequences of words that were never observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Network (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally to designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context.

We show there is a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, but all architectures learn high quality contextual representations that outperform word embeddings for four challenging NLP tasks.

In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT\'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM\'s BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM\'s performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.","citations":["26e743d5bd465f49b9538deaf116c15e61b7951f","6e795c6e9916174ae12349f5dc3f516570c17ce8","cb0f3ee1e98faf92429d601cdcd76c69c1e484eb"],"references":["bff427c18caa092afff57a400e353fde79254f22","052b1d8ce63b07fec3de9dbb583772d860b7c769","23694a80bf1b9b38215be3e23068dd75296bc90f","47a87c2cbdd928bb081974d308b3d9cf678d257e"]},{"paper_id":"bff427c18caa092afff57a400e353fde79254f22","paper_title":"BACKPROPAGATION THROUGH TIME: WHAT IT DOES AND HOW TO DO IT","paper_year":1990,"paper_venue":"","paper_citations":999,"paper_abstract":"","citations":["b9de9599d7241459db9213b5cdd7059696f5ef8d"],"references":[]},{"paper_id":"a4cec122a08216fe8a3bc19b22e78fbaea096256","paper_title":"Deep Learning","paper_year":2015,"paper_venue":"Nature","paper_citations":999,"paper_abstract":"Machine-learning technology powers many aspects of modern society: from web searches to content filtering on social networks to recommendations on e-commerce websites, and it is increasingly present in consumer products such as cameras and smartphones. Machine-learning systems are used to identify objects in images, transcribe speech into text, match news items, posts or products with users\u2019 interests, and select relevant results of search. Increasingly, these applications make use of a class of techniques called deep learning. Conventional machine-learning techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form. For decades, constructing a pattern-recognition or machine-learning system required careful engineering and considerable domain expertise to design a feature extractor that transformed the raw data (such as the pixel values of an image) into a suitable internal representation or feature vector from which the learning subsystem, often a classifier, could detect or classify patterns in the input. Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification. Deep-learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. With the composition of enough such transformations, very complex functions can be learned. For classification tasks, higher layers of representation amplify aspects of the input that are important for discrimination and suppress irrelevant variations. An image, for example, comes in the form of an array of pixel values, and the learned features in the first layer of representation typically represent the presence or absence of edges at particular orientations and locations in the image. The second layer typically detects motifs by spotting particular arrangements of edges, regardless of small variations in the edge positions. The third layer may assemble motifs into larger combinations that correspond to parts of familiar objects, and subsequent layers would detect objects as combinations of these parts. The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers of features are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure. Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for many years. It has turned out to be very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data and is therefore applicable to many domains of science, business and government. In addition to beating records in image recognition and speech recognition, it has beaten other machine-learning techniques at predicting the activity of potential drug molecules, analysing particle accelerator data, reconstructing brain circuits, and predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding DNA on gene expression and disease. Perhaps more surprisingly, deep learning has produced extremely promising results for various tasks in natural language understanding, particularly topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering and language translation. We think that deep learning will have many more successes in the near future because it requires very little engineering by hand, so it can easily take advantage of increases in the amount of available computation and data. New learning algorithms and architectures that are currently being developed for deep neural networks will only accelerate this progress.","citations":[],"references":["1827de6fa9c9c1b3d647a9d707042e89cf94abf0","dac72f2c509aee67524d3321f77e97e8eff51de6","1eb09fecd75eb27825dce4f964b97f4f5cc399d7","14ce7635ff18318e7094417d0f92acbec6669f1c","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","687bac2d3320083eb4530bf18bb8f8f721477600","38211dc39e41273c0007889202c69f841e02248a","d4e8bed3b50a035e1eabad614fe4218a34b3b178","cd62c9976534a6a2096a38244f6cbb03635a127e","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","843959ffdccf31c6694d135fad07425924f785b1","4a18360a14facea50dc819145b1daf4c53d5d59e","0e650b5e54a3624792952899a0f79b91a1d68e79","23694a80bf1b9b38215be3e23068dd75296bc90f","1a07186bc10592f0330655519ad91652125cd907","1a2a770d23b4a171fa81de62a78a3deb0588f238","e2b7f37cd97a7907b1b8a41138721ed06a0b76cd","2d9e3f53fcdb548b0b3c4d4efb197f164fe0c381","1005645c05585c2042e3410daeed638b55e2474d"]},{"paper_id":"52eec5b914f72c4cd3f03eaedf1d38bb9a4df6de","paper_title":"WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio","paper_year":2016,"paper_venue":"SSW","paper_citations":999,"paper_abstract":"This paper introduces WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating raw audio waveforms.

By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous embeddings and find that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CONLL03 shared task.

These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because large matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while a standard projected conjugate gradient (PCG) chunking algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO\'s computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. For the MNIST database, SMO is as fast as PCG chunking; while for the UCI Adult database and linear SVMs, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm.","citations":[],"references":[]},{"paper_id":"486af640c427afba9036799cbe2bc41774a4d6c2","paper_title":"Constraints on variables in syntax","paper_year":1967,"paper_venue":"","paper_citations":999,"paper_abstract":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class.

Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.","citations":["1e077413b25c4d34945cc2707e17e46ed4fe784a"],"references":["38211dc39e41273c0007889202c69f841e02248a","1a2a770d23b4a171fa81de62a78a3deb0588f238","2f4df08d9072fc2ac181b7fced6a245315ce05c8"]},{"paper_id":"0e6824e137847be0599bb0032e37042ed2ef5045","paper_title":"Aligning Books and Movies: Towards Story-Like Visual Explanations by Watching Movies and Reading Books","paper_year":2015,"paper_venue":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","paper_citations":287,"paper_abstract":"Books are a rich source of both fine-grained information, how a character, an object or a scene looks like, as well as high-level semantics, what someone is thinking, feeling and how these states evolve through a story.

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context.

Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features.

Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods.

We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models.","citations":["1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","dac72f2c509aee67524d3321f77e97e8eff51de6","87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f","c4fd9c86b2b41df51a6fe212406dda81b1997fd4","bc1d609520290e0460c49b685675eb5a57fa5935","a4cec122a08216fe8a3bc19b22e78fbaea096256"],"references":["783480acff435bfbc15ffcdb4f15eccddaa0c810","d4e8bed3b50a035e1eabad614fe4218a34b3b178","23694a80bf1b9b38215be3e23068dd75296bc90f"]},{"paper_id":"26e743d5bd465f49b9538deaf116c15e61b7951f","paper_title":"Learning Distributed Representations of Sentences from Unlabelled Data","paper_year":2016,"paper_venue":"HLT-NAACL","paper_citations":238,"paper_abstract":"Unsupervised methods for learning distributed representations of words are ubiquitous in today\'s NLP research, but far less is known about the best ways to learn distributed phrase or sentence representations from unlabelled data.

Deeper, more complex models are preferable for representations to be used in supervised systems, but shallow log-linear models work best for building representation spaces that can be decoded with simple spatial distance metrics. We also propose two new unsupervised representation-learning objectives designed to optimise the trade-off between training time, domain portability and performance.","citations":["0bb4cadc80c0afaf29c57518dc9c06f8fcfa5f38","a23fa96e7217ba0e9405d9e1fe3cdedd57b6e096","ee7b883e35d754ae4f71c21bb71f9f03e4ffbb2c","a97dc52807d80454e78d255f9fbd7b0fab56bd03","bc8fa64625d9189f5801837e7b133e7fe3c581f7","bc1d609520290e0460c49b685675eb5a57fa5935","93b8da28d006415866bf48f9a6e06b5242129195","0c47cad9729c38d9db1f75491b1ee4bd883a5d4e"],"references":["1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","e2b7f37cd97a7907b1b8a41138721ed06a0b76cd","87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","843959ffdccf31c6694d135fad07425924f785b1"]},{"paper_id":"59761abc736397539bdd01ad7f9d91c8607c0457","paper_title":"context2vec: Learning Generic Context Embedding with Bidirectional LSTM","paper_year":2016,"paper_venue":"CoNLL","paper_citations":124,"paper_abstract":"Context representations are central to various NLP tasks, such as word sense disambiguation, named entity recognition, coreference resolution, and many more.

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks.

This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, \u201cKing Man + Woman\u201d results in a vector very close to \u201cQueen.\u201d We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40% of the questions.

Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar to words forming an already seen sentence.
