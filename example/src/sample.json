Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. \nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).", "paper_authors": ["Jacob Devlin", "Ming-Wei Chang", "Kenton Lee", "Kristina Toutanova"], "citations": [], "references": ["007ab5528b3bd310a80d553cccad4b78dc496b02", "10f97f1fb4f5c2c8e6c44d4a33da46d331dd4aeb", "6e795c6e9916174ae12349f5dc3f516570c17ce8", "128cb6b891aee1b5df099acb48e2efecfcff689f", "05dd7254b632376973f3a1b4d39485da17814df5", "bc1d609520290e0460c49b685675eb5a57fa5935", "7f4afc1bf3272ae6ec00b46e27efc4a4f6b0826d", "cb0f3ee1e98faf92429d601cdcd76c69c1e484eb", "4361e64f2d12d63476fdc88faf72a0f70d9a2ffb", "26e743d5bd465f49b9538deaf116c15e61b7951f", "87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f", "93b8da28d006415866bf48f9a6e06b5242129195", "8c1b00128e74f1cd92aede3959690615695d5101", "a97dc52807d80454e78d255f9fbd7b0fab56bd03", "0bb4cadc80c0afaf29c57518dc9c06f8fcfa5f38", "766ce989b8b8b984f7a4691fd8c9af4bdb2b74cd", "ee7b883e35d754ae4f71c21bb71f9f03e4ffbb2c", "1005645c05585c2042e3410daeed638b55e2474d", "dbde7dfa6cae81df8ac19ef500c42db96c3d1edd", "2c5135a0531bc5ad7dd890f018e67a40529f5bcb", "27e98e09cf09bc13c913d01676e5f32624011050", "843959ffdccf31c6694d135fad07425924f785b1", "f04df4e20a18358ea2f689b4c129781628ef7fc1", "1e077413b25c4d34945cc2707e17e46ed4fe784a", "5d833331b0e22ff359db05c62a8bca18c4f04b68", "1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0", "3febb2bed8865945e7fddc99efd791887bb7e14f", "0c47cad9729c38d9db1f75491b1ee4bd883a5d4e", "ac11062f1f368d97f4c826c317bf50dcc13fdb59", "1a07186bc10592f0330655519ad91652125cd907", "e0222a1ae6874f7fff128c3da8769ab95963da04", "af5c4b80fbf847f69a202ba5a780a3dd18c1a027", "38211dc39e41273c0007889202c69f841e02248a", "687bac2d3320083eb4530bf18bb8f8f721477600", "081651b38ff7533550a3adfc1c00da333a8fe86c", "26b47e35fe6e4260fdf7b7cc98f279a73c277494", "f010affab57b5fcf1cd6be23df79d8ec98c7289c", "59761abc736397539bdd01ad7f9d91c8607c0457", "a23fa96e7217ba0e9405d9e1fe3cdedd57b6e096", "dac72f2c509aee67524d3321f77e97e8eff51de6", "f37e1b62a767a307c046404ca96bc140b3e68cb5", "5ded2b8c64491b4a67f6d39ce473d4b9347a672e", "cd18800a0fe0b668a1cc19f2ec95b5003d0a5035", "421fc2556836a6b441de806d7b393a35b6eaea58", "bc8fa64625d9189f5801837e7b133e7fe3c581f7", "0e6824e137847be0599bb0032e37042ed2ef5045", "475354f10798f110d34792b6d88f31d6d5cb099e", "2cd8e8f510c89c7c18268e8ad51c061e459ad321", "3c78c6df5eb1695b6a399e346dde880af27d1016", "783480acff435bfbc15ffcdb4f15eccddaa0c810", "9fa8d73e572c3ca824a04a5f551b602a17831bc5", "b9de9599d7241459db9213b5cdd7059696f5ef8d", "204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776", "4aa9f5150b46320f534de4747a2dd0cd7f3fe292"], "score": 1.0}, "branches": [[[{"paper_id": "38211dc39e41273c0007889202c69f841e02248a", "paper_title": "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database", "paper_year": 2009, "paper_venue": "2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "paper_citations": 36, "paper_abstract": "The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data.

We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering.

Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.", "paper_authors": ["Jason Yosinski", "Jeff Clune", "Yoshua Bengio", "Hod Lipson"], "citations": ["df2b0e26d0599ce3e70df8a9da02e51594e0e992", "1e077413b25c4d34945cc2707e17e46ed4fe784a"], "references": ["38211dc39e41273c0007889202c69f841e02248a", "abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff"], "score": 1.443522425134828}, {"paper_id": "4361e64f2d12d63476fdc88faf72a0f70d9a2ffb", "paper_title": "Bridging Nonlinearities and Stochastic Regularizers with Gaussian Error Linear Units", "paper_year": 2017, "paper_venue": "ArXiv", "paper_citations": 3, "paper_abstract": "We propose the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), a high-performing neural network activation function.

Machine-learning systems are used to identify objects in images, transcribe speech into text, match news items, posts or products with users\u2019 interests, and select relevant results of search. Increasingly, these applications make use of a class of techniques called deep learning. Conventional machine-learning techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form. For decades, constructing a pattern-recognition or machine-learning system required careful engineering and considerable domain expertise to design a feature extractor that transformed the raw data (such as the pixel values of an image) into a suitable internal representation or feature vector from which the learning subsystem, often a classifier, could detect or classify patterns in the input. Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification. Deep-learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. With the composition of enough such transformations, very complex functions can be learned. For classification tasks, higher layers of representation amplify aspects of the input that are important for discrimination and suppress irrelevant variations. An image, for example, comes in the form of an array of pixel values, and the learned features in the first layer of representation typically represent the presence or absence of edges at particular orientations and locations in the image. The second layer typically detects motifs by spotting particular arrangements of edges, regardless of small variations in the edge positions. The third layer may assemble motifs into larger combinations that correspond to parts of familiar objects, and subsequent layers would detect objects as combinations of these parts. The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers of features are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure. Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for many years. It has turned out to be very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data and is therefore applicable to many domains of science, business and government. In addition to beating records in image recognition and speech recognition, it has beaten other machine-learning techniques at predicting the activity of potential drug molecules, analysing particle accelerator data, reconstructing brain circuits, and predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding DNA on gene expression and disease. Perhaps more surprisingly, deep learning has produced extremely promising results for various tasks in natural language understanding, particularly topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering and language translation.

However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods.

Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited models and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to Google's phrase-based production system.", "paper_authors": ["Yonghui Wu", "Mike Schuster", "Zhifeng Chen", "Quoc V.

Neural autoregressive and seq2seq models that generate text by sampling words sequentially, with each word conditioned on the previous model, are state-of-the-art for several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure of sample quality. Language models are typically trained via maximum likelihood and most often with teacher forcing. Teacher forcing is well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality because generating text requires conditioning on sequences of words that were never observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Network (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally to designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1.

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.", "paper_authors": ["Dzmitry Bahdanau", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Yoshua Bengio"], "citations": ["007ab5528b3bd310a80d553cccad4b78dc496b02", "6e795c6e9916174ae12349f5dc3f516570c17ce8", "39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f", "4e88de2930a4435f737c3996287a90ff87b95c59", "93b8da28d006415866bf48f9a6e06b5242129195", "9784fbf77295860b2e412137b86356d70b25e3c0", "8c1b00128e74f1cd92aede3959690615695d5101", "146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616", "dbde7dfa6cae81df8ac19ef500c42db96c3d1edd", "27e98e09cf09bc13c913d01676e5f32624011050", "b798cfd967e1a9ca5e7bc995d33a907bf65d1c7f", "0c47cad9729c38d9db1f75491b1ee4bd883a5d4e", "e0222a1ae6874f7fff128c3da8769ab95963da04", "47570e7f63e296f224a0e7f9a0d08b0de3cbaf40", "a4cec122a08216fe8a3bc19b22e78fbaea096256", "0e6824e137847be0599bb0032e37042ed2ef5045", "bc8fa64625d9189f5801837e7b133e7fe3c581f7", "2cd8e8f510c89c7c18268e8ad51c061e459ad321", "93499a7c7f699b6630a86fad964536f9423bb6d0", "d1505c6123c102e53eb19dff312cb25cea840b72", "204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776"], "references": ["944a1cfd79dbfb6fef460360a0765ba790f4027a", "39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f", "23694a80bf1b9b38215be3e23068dd75296bc90f", "0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa", "0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e", "652d159bf64a70194127722d19841daa99a69b64"], "score": 0.5505805521360444}, {"paper_id": "39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f", "paper_title": "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks", "paper_year": 2014, "paper_venue": "NIPS", "paper_citations": 128, "paper_abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.", "paper_authors": ["Ilya Sutskever", "Oriol Vinyals", "Quoc V.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.", "paper_authors": ["Diederik P.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches over the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures has established a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT'15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.", "paper_authors": ["Thang Luong", "Hieu Pham", "Christopher D.

When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, \"powerful,\" \"strong\" and \"Paris\" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document.

On unlabeled examples, CVT teaches auxiliary prediction modules that see restricted views of the input (e.g., only part of a sentence) to match the predictions of the full model seeing the whole input. Since the auxiliary modules and the full model share intermediate representations, this in turn improves the full model.

We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data.

By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous embeddings and find that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CONLL03 shared task.

We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied.

Efforts to obtain embeddings for larger chunks of text, such as sentences, have however not been so successful.

In this paper, we show how universal sentence representations trained using the supervised data of the Stanford Natural Language Inference datasets can consistently outperform unsupervised methods like SkipThought vectors on a wide range of transfer tasks. Much like how computer vision uses ImageNet to obtain features, which can then be transferred to other tasks, our work tends to indicate the suitability of natural language inference for transfer learning to other NLP tasks.

On the Stanford question answering dataset, a single DCN model improves the previous state of the art from 71.0% F1 to 75.9%, while a DCN ensemble obtains 80.4% F1.", "paper_authors": ["Caiming Xiong", "Victor Zhong", "Richard Socher"], "citations": ["27e98e09cf09bc13c913d01676e5f32624011050", "9784fbf77295860b2e412137b86356d70b25e3c0", "8c1b00128e74f1cd92aede3959690615695d5101", "b798cfd967e1a9ca5e7bc995d33a907bf65d1c7f", "bc8fa64625d9189f5801837e7b133e7fe3c581f7", "e0222a1ae6874f7fff128c3da8769ab95963da04", "26b47e35fe6e4260fdf7b7cc98f279a73c277494"], "references": ["f37e1b62a767a307c046404ca96bc140b3e68cb5", "05dd7254b632376973f3a1b4d39485da17814df5", "b1e20420982a4f923c08652941666b189b11b7fe", "1ee46c3b71ebe336d0b278de9093cfca7af7390b", "272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d", "0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa", "93499a7c7f699b6630a86fad964536f9423bb6d0", "d1505c6123c102e53eb19dff312cb25cea840b72", "6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad"], "score": 0.45437512619681886}, {"paper_id": "1ee46c3b71ebe336d0b278de9093cfca7af7390b", "paper_title": "The Goldilocks Principle: Reading Children's Books with Explicit Memory Representations", "paper_year": 2015, "paper_venue": "ICLR", "paper_citations": 42, "paper_abstract": "Abstract: We introduce a new test of how well language models capture meaning in children's books. Unlike standard language modelling benchmarks, it distinguishes the task of predicting syntactic function words from that of predicting lower-frequency words, which carry greater semantic content. We compare a range of state-of-the-art models, each with a different way of encoding what has been previously read. We show that models which store explicit representations of long-term contexts outperform state-of-the-art neural language models at predicting semantic content words, although this advantage is not observed for syntactic function words. Interestingly, we find that the amount of text encoded in a single memory representation is highly influential to the performance: there is a sweet-spot, not too big and not too small, between single words and full sentences that allows the most meaningful information in a text to be effectively retained and recalled. Further, the attention over such window-based memories can be trained effectively through self-supervision. We then assess the generality of this principle by applying it to the CNN QA benchmark, which involves identifying named entities in paraphrased summaries of news articles, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.", "paper_authors": ["Felix Hill", "Antoine Bordes", "Sumit Chopra", "Jason Weston"], "citations": ["27e98e09cf09bc13c913d01676e5f32624011050", "f010affab57b5fcf1cd6be23df79d8ec98c7289c", "007ab5528b3bd310a80d553cccad4b78dc496b02", "8c1b00128e74f1cd92aede3959690615695d5101", "05dd7254b632376973f3a1b4d39485da17814df5", "b1e20420982a4f923c08652941666b189b11b7fe", "b798cfd967e1a9ca5e7bc995d33a907bf65d1c7f", "5171157c2c09a85ad6558c5c03da6b75b0cf5fe6", "e0222a1ae6874f7fff128c3da8769ab95963da04", "3c78c6df5eb1695b6a399e346dde880af27d1016", "26b47e35fe6e4260fdf7b7cc98f279a73c277494"], "references": ["d1505c6123c102e53eb19dff312cb25cea840b72", "2b669398c4cf2ebe04375c8b1beae20f4ac802fa", "146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616", "93499a7c7f699b6630a86fad964536f9423bb6d0"], "score": 0.484755063668199}]]], "clusterNames": ["neural network", "machine translation", "sentence representation", "language model", "language inference", "reading comprehension"], "importance": [0.10658092027227352, 0.14052304508559332, 0.1810971511798507, 0.2678711355049088, 0.16519512619233528, 0.13873262176503834], "related_paper_titles": ["Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training", "Glove: Global Vectors for Word Representation", "Deep contextualized word representations", "GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding", "Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality"]}
